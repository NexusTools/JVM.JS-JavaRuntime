     * The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but

     * <p>The values returned by this method become meaningful only when
     * the difference between two such values, obtained within the same
     * instance of a Java virtual machine, is computed.
     *
     * <p> For example, to measure how long some code takes to execute:
     *  <pre> {@code
     * long startTime = System.nanoTime();
     * // ... the code being measured ...
     * long estimatedTime = System.nanoTime() - startTime;}</pre>

     *  <pre> {@code
     * long t0 = System.nanoTime();

     * long t1 = System.nanoTime();}</pre>
     *
     * one should use {@code t1 - t0 < 0}, not {@code t1 < t0},
